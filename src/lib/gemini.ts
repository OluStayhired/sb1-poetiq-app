    Your job is to write high-performing content for ${calendar_info}
    
    Create a ${calendarDays}-day content calendar based on this information: ${calendar_info}

This content calendar MUST start with the day of the week as ${startDayofWeek}.    

    Requirements:
    1. Create exactly ${calendarDays} days of content, starting with the first day's day_of_week being "${startDayofWeek}".
    2. Focus on the target audience's pain points
    3. Ensure each day has a unique theme
    4. Keep topics concise and actionable
    5. Include clear calls to action
    6. Limit response to one complete table
    7. Do not include any follow-up questions or suggestions
    8. Notes provide context or tips
    9. Content is engaging and platform appropriate
    10. Remove hashtags and generic content 
    11. Keep content to 400 characters

Generate a ${calendarDays}-day content calendar in valid JSON format. 
The first day in the calendar MUST have "day_of_week": "${startDayofWeek}".
Provide the output as a JSON array with exactly ${calendarDays} objects each containing:
    {
      "day":(number 1-${calendarDays}),
      "day_of_week": (full day name e.g. "Monday"),
      "theme": (theme for the day),
      "topic": (specific topic),
      "content": (actual post content),
      "call_to_action": (specific CTA),
      "notes": (additional notes or tips)
      
    }

Example of the first object in the JSON array:
    {
      "day": 1,
      "day_of_week": "${startDayofWeek}",
      "theme": "...",
      "topic": "...",
      "content": "...",
      "call_to_action": "...",
      "notes": "..."
    }    

Ensure that:

* All string values (day_of_week, theme, topic, content, call_to_action, notes) are enclosed in double quotes.

* Any special characters within string values (e.g., forward slashes / , backslashes and [ and ] should be properly escaped to prevent JSON parsing errors.

* Specifically, square brackets [ and ] should be escaped as \[ and \].

**Your primary task is to generate a single, complete social media post.** This post MUST begin with a compelling, original hook that is seamlessly integrated.

**Based on the provided content idea (${content}), subject (${theme}), and specific topic (${topic}), generate a unique and effective hook.**

**Crucially, the hook MUST be generated using the following archetype description:**

**Archetype: ${chosenHookArchetype.name}**
**Description: ${chosenHookArchetype.description.replace('target audience', target_audience).replace('topic', topic).replace('content', content)}**

**The hook should:**
- Be the very first sentence of your output.
- Be concise (ideally 1-2 sentences).
- Directly relevant to the ${topic}, ${theme}, and ${content}.
- Be designed to stop the scroll and encourage further reading.
- NOT contain bracketed placeholders like "[activity]" or "[goal]". You must deduce and integrate the relevant concepts directly.

After generating the hook, seamlessly transition into and build upon the content idea "${content}" that touches on subject "${theme}" specifically about "${topic}". Improve it so that the total output (hook + body) is an ${char_length} character content.

   Act as an experienced social media content marketer with 10 years experience, create a ${calendarDays}-day content calendar based on this information: ${calendar_info}

This content calendar MUST start with the day of the week as ${startDayofWeek}.    

    Requirements:
    1. Create exactly ${calendarDays} days of content, starting with the first day's day_of_week being "${startDayofWeek}".
    2. Focus on the target audience's pain points
    3. Ensure each day has a unique theme
    4. Keep topics concise and actionable
    5. Include clear calls to action
    6. Limit response to one complete table
    7. Do not include any follow-up questions or suggestions
    8. Notes provide context or tips
    9. Content is engaging and platform appropriate
    10. Remove hashtags and generic content 
    11. Place each sentence in the post on a new line.
    12. Add a space after each line for readability

Generate a ${calendarDays}-day content calendar in valid JSON format. 
The first day in the calendar MUST have "day_of_week": "${startDayofWeek}".
Provide the output as a JSON array with exactly ${calendarDays} objects each containing:
    {
      "day":(number 1-${calendarDays}),
      "day_of_week": (full day name e.g. "Monday"),
      "theme": (theme for the day),
      "topic": (specific topic),
      "content": (actual post content),
      "call_to_action": (specific CTA),
      "notes": (additional notes or tips)
      
    }

Example of the first object in the JSON array:
    {
      "day": 1,
      "day_of_week": "${startDayofWeek}",
      "theme": "...",
      "topic": "...",
      "content": "...",
      "call_to_action": "...",
      "notes": "..."
    }    

Ensure that:

* All string values (day_of_week, theme, topic, content, call_to_action, notes) are enclosed in double quotes.

* Any special characters within string values (e.g., forward slashes / , backslashes and [ and ] should be properly escaped to prevent JSON parsing errors.

* Specifically, square brackets [ and ] should be escaped as \[ and \].
