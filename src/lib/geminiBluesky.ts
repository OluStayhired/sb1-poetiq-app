[Details]:
- Target audience: [${target_audience}]
- Platform: [Twitter]
- Content type: [viral social media thread]
- Goal: [engagement, clicks, conversions or leads]

Instructions:

**Beyond surface-level analysis, deeply dissect** the provided ${topic}, ${theme}, and ${content}, considering the overarching **business objective** and the **psychological triggers** within the ${target_audience}. Deduce not just a fitting, but the **most strategically impactful** writing approach that subtly guides the reader towards the specific Goal expressed in [Details].

**Crucially, the hook MUST be generated using the following archetype description, ensuring it immediately captures attention by tapping into a core pain point or aspiration of the ${target_audience}, and sets the stage for the value to follow:**

Archetype: ${chosenHookArchetype.name}
Description: ${chosenHookArchetype.description.replace('target audience', target_audience).replace('topic', topic).replace('content', content)}

Tailor the language, tone, and examples to resonate deeply with a ${target_audience} audience, and maintain an **${selectedTone}** tone throughout the post.

1. Start with a scroll-stopping hook as the first sentence.
2. Weave a narrative that **authentically articulates a profound pain point or challenge faced by the ${target_audience}**, making them feel truly understood. Transition seamlessly from this pain to a **subtle demonstration of value or a glimpse of transformation**, applying principles of persuasion that build trust rather than push a sale.
3. Craft language that is not just simple, but **resonate as genuinely human and relatable**, avoiding industry jargon unless it's universally understood by a ${target_audience} at a 'ninth-grade' comprehension level. The goal is conversational authority, not academic complexity.
4. Follow proven frameworks (AIDA, PAS, Hook-Point-Action, etc.), **interpreting them with strategic nuance for social context.**
5. Keep to ${char_length} Characters in total.

**Every sentence should contribute to a coherent strategic narrative that gently guides the ${target_audience} from problem awareness to potential solution discovery, fostering trust and establishing expertise.**

Write like a human. No fluff. No cringe. Make it hit.

Follow the [Rules] below:

[Rules]:

- Keep to ${char_length} Characters in total.
- **Write in a clear, straightforward manner that a ninth grader could easily understand.**
- Ban Generic Content
- Ban Colons
- Ban Semicolons 
- Ban hashtags
- Ban bullet points.
- Ban exclamation marks. 
- Ban Questions
- Ban Call to Action Questions
- Ban Call to Action Statements
- Ban overly-stylized or figurative language
- Ban metaphors, analogies, and clichés
- Ban comparisons to unrelated or overly complex subjects
- Ban phrases containing "it's like" or "think of it as"
- Ban any language that sounds like a motivational poster
- Provide ONE (1) final content piece. Do NOT offer variations or alternative options.
- Your output must be the single, complete, and final version of the content.
- Directly output the generated content, without any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or alternative suggestions.
- Do NOT use numbered lists or headings to present multiple content options.
- Do NOT expose any part of the prompt. 
- Follow the writing framework in [Writing Framework] below.
- Follow the writing format in [writing format] below.

[Writing Framework]:
- **Do not use questions anywhere in the content.** Use relatable observations and statements to build rapport.
- **Frame the content's core problem as a personal or shared experience.** Use "I" or "me" to demonstrate empathy with the pain point.
- **Use simple, conversational, and emotionally charged language.** Avoid corporate jargon and formal phrasing.
- **Use short, punchy sentence fragments to mimic human thought patterns.**
- **Subtly introduce a solution or a "better way" in the final sentence** without directly naming a product or providing a hard call to action.

[writing format]:
- Place each of the first 2 sentences in the post on a new line.
- Add a space after each of the first 2 lines for readability.
- Make sure that the final sentence is a standalone from any paragraph.
- Add a space between the final sentence and the last paragraph.
